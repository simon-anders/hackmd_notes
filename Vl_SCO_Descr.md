# Modulbeschreibung // Lecture "Applied Mathematics in Biology: Single-cell omics"

*This is a draft description for a lecture I would like to offer in summer term 2023. Please contact me if you are interested in attending.*

### Titel (title)

Applied Mathematics in Biology: Single-cell omics

### Dozent (lecturer)

Simon Anders, BioQuant Center
(simon.anders@bioquant.uni-heidelberg.de)

### Zeit (time)

to be agreed upon

### Kurzbeschreibung (short description)

Modern molecular biology relies much on data-intensive experimental methods that require advance mathematical approaches for data analysis and interpretation. Thus, there is a need in biology for researchers from mathematical fields (such as physics, engineering, scientific computing, etc.). This interdisciplinary course aims as exposing students from these fields (but also biology students with mathematical knowledge) to a cutting-edge area of biology, namely single-cell omics.

We will learn how in single-cell omics methods, large data vectors are obtained for thousands of individual cells, and how methods from high-dimensional statistics, linear algebra, machine learning, graph theory, and geometry are used to gain bioloical insights form the data.

### Lernziele (aims)

Many experimental techniques of modern biology need sophisticated data analysis methods. Developing these requires, among others, mastery of methods of mathematical modelling, of stochastic models, of numerics and scientific software engineering. Therefore, such methodolical research falls outside the expertise of most biologists; and is a task for applied mathematicians, physicists or math-oriented computer scientists. 

One particular topic of currently rapidly growing importance is "single-cell omics": For several tissue samples, each comprising hundreds to thousands of cells, one measures for each cell a large vector of values that represent, e.g., the activity of genes or the epigenetic state in cells. This allows to, e.g., compare, healthy and diseased tissues, understand the make-up of tumours, track the embryonic development of organs, etc. In such data, each cell is represented by a vector in a feature space (typically simply $\mathbb{R}^n$) and the aim is to explore the geometry and topology of the manifolds sampled by the cells and translate the findings into the language of biology, and to perform statistical inference to gain generalizable conclusions about the experiment. 

An aim of the lecture is therefore to introduce students to this area of work for researchers in applied mathematics. However, rather than giving a general overview, we will explore a specific field, namely single-cell omics, in depth, and learn not only how to bring modern methods of mathematics and scientific computing to bear on a problems of practical importance but also how to grapple with the communication difficulties of building bridges between two disciplines, mathematics and biology, with different language, concepts and ways of thinking.

Starting with the basics of the relevant parts of biology and applied math, we will advance to the current methodological frontier of the field.
